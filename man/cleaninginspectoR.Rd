\title{Data Cleaning Checks}
\description{
rudimentary checks to flag potentially problematic values in a dataset
}
\details{
\subsection{Functionality}
\itemize{
\item \code{inspect_all()}: applies all checks listed below
\item \code{find_duplicates()} looks for duplicates in columns that should be unique
\item \code{find_duplicates_uuid()} looks for a function containing "uuid" in the name and looks for duplicates
\item \code{find_outliers()} looks for outliers in numerical columns
\item \code{find_other_responses()} looks for values in potential "if other, specify.." type of columns
\item \code{sensitive_columns()} looks for keywords of sensitive variables in column names
}

\subsection{Output}

The output has the same structure for all functions of this package:

A data frame with the following columns:
value	variable	has_issue	issue_type
\itemize{
\item \code{index}: the index of the row of the original data in which the issue occured.  (NA if applies to multiple rows)
\item \code{value} the suspicious value
\item \code{variable} The column containing the suspicious value
\item \code{has_issue} logical TRUE/FALSE: currently always true, can be ignored.
\item \code{issue_type} a description/name of the potential issue
}

\subsection{Limitations}
\enumerate{
\item These checks are under no circumstances sufficient or complete in any way, and more context and data specific checks are always necessary.
\item the check for sensitive columns \code{sensitive_columns()} is \emph{rudimentary} at best and is under no circumstances sufficient to ensure data protection in any way
\item Although tempting, this package should \emph{never} be used to automatically remove any flagged values. This would seriously skew your dataset, and make uncertainty estimates invalid. Potential issues must be investigated on a case by case basis.
